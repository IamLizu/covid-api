# covid-api

Just another simple covid information API for Bangladesh. All time and last 24 hour data is collected via web scrapping with `cheerio` and served.

Information scrapped from [Ministry of Health and Family Welfare](https://dghs.gov.bd/index.php/en/) is cached with Redis for faster serving.
